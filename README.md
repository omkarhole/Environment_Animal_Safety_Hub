## 🌊 Altered River Flow from Hydropower Dams

Hydropower dams significantly impact river ecosystems. This section explores:

- **Fish Migration**: Investigating how disrupted flow regimes affect migratory patterns of fish species.
- **Sediment Transport**: Analyzing changes in sediment deposition and erosion downstream.
- **Biodiversity**: Studying the effects on aquatic and riparian biodiversity due to altered flow dynamics.

This research aims to provide actionable insights for sustainable hydropower development and river ecosystem conservation.

For detailed information, see: [Hydropower Dams Impact Study](MD/HYDROPOWER_DAMS_README.md)

## 🌊 Climate Change and Deep-Sea Biodiversity Loss

Climate change is profoundly impacting deep-sea ecosystems through ocean warming and deoxygenation. This section explores:

- **Ocean Warming**: How rising temperatures affect slow-growing deep-sea organisms.
- **Deoxygenation**: The impacts of declining oxygen levels on deep-sea biodiversity.
- **Vulnerable Species**: Focus on species with long lifespans and slow reproduction rates.

Understanding these impacts is crucial for deep-sea conservation in the face of climate change.
