#### 4. **Content Areas**

##### The Trophy Hunting Phenomenon
- Statistics: Global scale of trophy hunting industry
- Economic impact: Billion-dollar industry with conservation trade-offs
- Global health significance for biodiversity and ecosystem stability

##### Selective Pressure Mechanisms
- **Size-biased harvesting**: Targeting largest individuals
- **Phenotypic selection**: Removing genetically superior traits
- **Frequency-dependent selection**: Changes in population trait distributions
- **Sexual selection disruption**: Impact on mating systems

##### Genetic Consequences
- **Reduced genetic diversity**: Loss of alleles and heterozygosity
- **Inbreeding depression**: Increased homozygosity and fitness reduction
- **Evolutionary changes**: Shifts in body size and reproductive strategies
- **Population viability**: Reduced adaptability to environmental changes

##### Social and Behavioral Impacts
- **Dominance hierarchy disruption**: Changes in social structure
- **Reproductive skew**: Altered mating patterns and success
- **Parental care changes**: Impact on offspring survival
- **Behavioral adaptations**: Changes in territoriality and aggression

##### Species-Specific Case Studies
- **African elephants**: Tusk size reduction and social structure changes
- **North American bighorn sheep**: Horn size evolution and mating success
- **Tropical deer species**: Antler size reduction and population dynamics
- **African lions**: Mane size changes and social behavior shifts

##### Conservation Solutions
- **Hunting regulations**: Size limits and quota systems
- **Protected areas**: Trophy hunting bans in sensitive areas
- **Genetic monitoring**: Population genetic assessment programs
- **Sustainable practices**: Alternative livelihood development
- **International cooperation**: Cross-border conservation efforts
- **Public awareness**: Education about ecological consequences
