# Freshwater Salinization from Road De-Icing - Feature Documentation

## Issue #1530: Freshwater Salinization from Road De-Icing

### Overview
This educational feature examines how salt runoff from road de-icing operations alters freshwater chemistry, creating osmotic stress that impacts fish physiology and reduces aquatic invertebrate diversity. The page provides comprehensive information about the mechanisms of salinization, its ecological consequences, and potential mitigation strategies.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Educational Content Structure**
- Hero section introducing freshwater salinization crisis
- Overview of road salt usage and runoff patterns
- Detailed mechanisms of chemical alteration in freshwater systems
- Species-specific impact sections for fish and aquatic invertebrates

#### 2. **Mechanisms of Salinization**
- Sodium chloride accumulation in freshwater ecosystems
- Seasonal runoff patterns and concentration spikes
- Chronic vs. acute exposure effects
- Bioaccumulation in food webs

#### 3. **Fish Physiology Impacts**
- Osmoregulatory stress and energy expenditure
- Gill damage and respiratory impairment
- Reproductive and developmental effects
- Species-specific sensitivity variations
- Migration and habitat avoidance behaviors

#### 4. **Aquatic Invertebrate Diversity Effects**
- Changes in species composition and abundance
- Mayfly and stonefly population declines
- Amphipod and crayfish sensitivity
- Trophic cascade implications
- Biodiversity loss in benthic communities

#### 5. **Case Studies**
- Urban watershed salinization examples
- Lake and stream chloride concentration trends
- Fish population monitoring data
- Invertebrate community structure changes

#### 6. **Solutions and Prevention**
- Alternative de-icing materials (calcium chloride, acetates)
- Improved stormwater management
- Salt application best practices
- Regulatory frameworks and monitoring programs

#### 7. **Interactive Elements**
- Animated chloride concentration charts
- Scroll-triggered impact visualizations
- Species vulnerability comparison tool
- Seasonal runoff simulation
