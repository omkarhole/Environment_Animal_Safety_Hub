# Endocrine Disruption from Agricultural Pesticides - Feature Documentation

## Issue #1480: Endocrine Disruption from Agricultural Pesticides

### Overview
This educational feature explores how chronic exposure to modern pesticides interferes with hormonal systems in amphibians, birds, and mammals, leading to developmental abnormalities. The page provides comprehensive information about endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their impacts on wildlife reproduction and development.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Educational Content Structure**
- Hero section introducing endocrine disruption
- Overview of the EDC crisis with key statistics
- Detailed mechanisms of hormone disruption
- Species-specific impact sections for amphibians, birds, and mammals

#### 2. **Mechanisms of Disruption**
- Hormone mimics that trigger false signals
- Hormone blockers that prevent normal function
- Critical timing during developmental stages
- Low-dose chronic exposure effects

#### 3. **Species-Specific Impacts**
- **Amphibians**: Sexual abnormalities, reproductive failure, deformities
- **Birds**: Eggshell thinning, behavioral changes, population declines
- **Mammals**: Reproductive disorders, developmental toxicity, immune suppression

#### 4. **Case Studies**
- Atrazine and amphibian hermaphroditism
- DDT and bird population crashes
- Glyphosate and mammalian reproduction effects

#### 5. **Solutions and Prevention**
- Regulatory action and stronger pesticide testing
- Sustainable agriculture practices
- Research and monitoring initiatives

#### 6. **Interactive Elements**
- Animated statistics counters
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Card hover effects
- Species section slide-in animations

### Scientific Accuracy
The content is based on established endocrinology and toxicology research including:
- Endocrine disruption research from EPA and WHO
- Pesticide toxicology studies
- Wildlife reproductive biology
- Amphibian decline research
- Bird reproductive studies

### Key Statistics Presented
- 800+ endocrine-disrupting chemicals identified
- 40% of amphibian species affected by pesticides
- 50% decline in bird reproductive success
- 2x higher risk of birth defects in mammals

### Responsive Design
The page is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop (1200px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile (< 768px)

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Screen reader compatible content

### Navigation Integration
The page is accessible through the main navigation under:
**Education → 🧪 Endocrine Disruption**

### Call-to-Action Links
- Organic gardening resources
- Community action hub
- Research donation support

### Educational Impact
This feature aims to:
- Raise awareness about endocrine disruption
- Explain complex hormonal mechanisms accessibly
- Highlight pesticide impacts on wildlife
- Promote sustainable agriculture practices
- Encourage support for stronger regulations

### Future Enhancements
- Interactive hormone system diagrams
- Pesticide impact maps
