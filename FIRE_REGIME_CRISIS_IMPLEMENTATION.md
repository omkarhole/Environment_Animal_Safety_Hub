# Fire Regime Shifts and Wildlife Adaptation Failure - Level 3 Crisis Implementation

## Issue #1501 - LEVEL 3 EMERGENCY

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Branch:** 1501  
**Crisis Level:** LEVEL 3 (Maximum Urgency)  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🚨 Crisis Overview

Fire Regime Shifts and Wildlife Adaptation Failure represents a **LEVEL 3 crisis** - the highest severity level in our environmental monitoring system. This crisis explores how increased wildfire frequency (400% increase since 1970) disrupts species adapted to historical fire cycles, causing population collapse across multiple ecosystems.

### Key Statistics
- 🔥 **400% increase** in fire frequency since 1970
- 🌲 **60%** of fire-adapted forests showing decline
- 🐾 **150+ species** at risk of adaptation failure
- ⚠️ **Critical regions:** Western North America, Australia, Mediterranean, Amazon Basin
