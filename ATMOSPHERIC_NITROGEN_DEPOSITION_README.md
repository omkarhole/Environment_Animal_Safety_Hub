# Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition and Forest Nutrient Imbalance - Issue #1636

## Overview

This educational feature explores the ecological impacts of excess nitrogen deposition from industrial emissions on forest ecosystems. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition occurs when reactive nitrogen compounds from fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, and industrial processes fall back to Earth, overloading forest soils with nutrients and disrupting natural nutrient balances.
